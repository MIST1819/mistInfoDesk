This python script has been made by var-greyShader

To run this script, copy the repository files to a new folder and open the terminal/command prompt in the directory.

type "python MistInfoDesk.py" in the terminal/command prompt

If you do not have python installed, install it on windows from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and if you are on Mac, or on Debian, you can istall it using:
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python3.6


However, to run this specific script, you'll need to install pyfiglet package using pip package manager.
You can do it typing the following in your terminal/command prompt

pip install pyfiglet 

And then voila! The program works. All the registration is saved as a new json file in the /responses directory


You are free to modify the script up to your needs but need to give credit to 
the author @var-greyShader and the organization @MIST1819 when you use this code elsewhere.
